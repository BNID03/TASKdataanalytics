**Tagline:** A practical series to master data transformation skills with Power Query in Power BI and Excel

## **Description**

Welcome to **Power Query Data Transformation Challenges** – a curated collection of real-world, hands-on exercises designed to build professional-level proficiency in data transformation using Power Query.

This repository provides a structured learning path through increasingly complex data transformation scenarios, mirroring common business data challenges. Each challenge presents raw, imperfect datasets that require systematic cleaning, reshaping, and preparation to achieve target outputs.

## **What You'll Master**

### **Core Competencies**
- **Data Diagnostics** – Identify anomalies, missing values, and inconsistencies in datasets
- **Transformation Logic** – Apply systematic cleaning and restructuring workflows
- **Advanced Manipulation** – Master pivoting, unpivoting, merging, and dynamic aggregations
- **Performance Optimization** – Implement efficient query design and data type management

### **Technical Skills Developed**
- Advanced text manipulation (Trim, Clean, Replace, Extract)
- Date/time standardization and calculations
- Custom column creation with M language
- Group By operations and aggregations
- Merge and Append query strategies
- Data quality validation techniques
- Parameterized query design


## **Challenge Framework**

Each challenge follows a standardized format:

### **Challenge Components**
1. **Raw Dataset** – Imperfect data with common issues (CSV/Excel format)
2. **Expected Output** – Visual representation of the target structure
3. **Success Criteria** – Clear validation metrics
4. **Skill Focus** – Primary and secondary learning objectives
5. **Difficulty Rating** – Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert

### **Recommended Workflow**
1. **Analyze** – Understand data structure and quality issues
2. **Plan** – Design transformation strategy before implementation
3. **Implement** – Build step-by-step transformations in Power Query
4. **Validate** – Compare results against expected output
5. **Optimize** – Refine for performance and maintainability
